# Teaching modern Optimization Algorithms within the SCF
This repo contains the files for teaching Steepest Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradients, AdaGrad, RMSProp and ADAM in the context of Hartree-Fock and Natural Orbital Theory. The content is intended to be used as a module in a course on numerical methods for quantum chemistry. It is intended to be used as a complement to the provided manuscript.

## 💡 Installation

You need to have [(mini/ana)conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed. The rest of the required packages can be installed in an environment by executing the following lines in the command line:

```bash
# Created a conda environment. Here we name it pynof.
conda create -y -n pynof2026 python=3.13
# Once created the environment we load it and install the required software
conda activate pynof2026

conda install psi4 -c conda-forge 
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy jupyter notebook pynof

# Clone the repo to get the notebooks and the code that must be modified
git clone https://github.com/felipelewyee/OptimRotEduc


## 📝 Usage

The file myCode/minimization.py contains a function called *orbopt_sd*, which can be used for doing orbital optimization with the steepest gradient descent algorithm. Students may use this algorithm as a model to code other gradient based minimization algorithms  (*orbopt_cg*, *orbopt_rmsprop*, *orbopt_adagrad*, and *orbopt_adam*) **required** to run the notebooks.

Once implemented, students can explore their perfomrance in Hartree-Fock and Natural Orbital Functional (NOF) theory. The content is organized in folders:

- Start with Hartree-Fock (HF folder), where you will a) code the optimization algorithms (in  
``` bash myCode/minimization.py ``` file) and explore the effect of the step size and b) compare the convergency of the algorithms at their best step size.

- Follow with Natural Orbital Functional (NOF folder) theory, where you can a) apply the optimization algorithms in a more complex landscape that includes electron correlation, and b) introduce the concept of a dynamic (scheduled) step size for improving convergency.

## Ackownledgements

The content is based on and makes use of [PyNOF](https://github.com/felipelewyee/PyNOF) (based on the Donostia Natural Orbital Functional Software, [DoNOF](https://github.com/DoNOF/DoNOFsw)) and [Psi4NumPy](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy) (based on [Psi4](https://github.com/psi4/psi4)) in a Jupyter Notebook workspace.

## About

These module was created by Ph.D. Juan Felipe Huan Lew-Yee, Prof. Xabier Lopez, Prof. Elixabete Rezabal, Prof. Mario Piris, and Prof. Jose M. Mercero for teaching in courses at the Chemistry Faculty of the **Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (EHU)** in the Basque Country.
